<h3>Mission</h3>
<div id="wrapper">
<p><i>Purpose of website</i></p>
<p>
Townsville Community Music Centre's website is established for two purposes as per content provided by client -
</p>
<ul>Membership
<li>To recruit new members</li>
<li>To increase engagement of members in our activities, e.g. volunteering for administration, organisation, and promotion of concerts and workshops</li></ul>
<ul>Concerts
<li>To increase ticket sales, especially to the general public</li>
<li>To encourage performers to let us organise concerts for them</li>
<li>To encourage performers to cooperate with promotional materials, photo-shoots, media releases, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<i>Why is the website needed? How does it benefit the client?</i>
<br/>
The website is created to meet Townsville Community Music Centre's above mentioned goals which includes increasing awareness of the music centre and revenue.
</p>
</div>

<div id="suc"></div>
<h3>Success Evaluation</h3>
<div id="wrapper">
<i>Description</i>
<ul>
<p>
<li>Key performance indicators are metrics that can be used to quantitatively measure Townsville Community Music Centre's website's success.</li>
<li>More general web analytics can be studied for an indication of the general performance of the website established. Software such as Google Analytics can be used to analyse data such as -</li>
</p>
<ol>
<li>volume of visitors to website</li>
<li>geographical location of visitors</li> 
<li>devices/ operating systems that visitors use </li>
<li>where visitors are directed to and from </li>
<li>how users navigate the website </li>
<li>the popularity of different pages</li>
<li>the conversion rate of the site</li>
</ol>
<br/>
In addition, bots and spiders are filtered out from viewable data by Google Analytics.
<li>A cache copy of the old website could be kept as a reference after the redeveloped website goes live. Any increase in performance or sales after the replacement will be credited to the establishment of the new Townsville Community Music Centre's website. 
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br/>

<div id="wrapper">
In an effort to meet the goals set out by the client, specific metrics must be accounted into more than others. 
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Increasing membership</i>
<p>
<ul>
<li>To recruit new members in Townsville Community Music Centre, the website should be developed to increase awareness. Awareness levels should therefore be measured by feedback tools such as Survey Monkey or Ask Your Target Market. These tools can also be used to gather information about what users think about the redevelopment as well as any constructive criticism they have to offer. </li>
<li>In addition, the conversion rate of visitors to the site signing up for Townsville Community Music Centre's services should be measured. Google Analytics can be used to retrieve this data. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<br/>
<i>To increase engagement of members in Townsville Community Music Centre's activities</i>
<ul>
<li>The average number of members involved for each specified activity such as volunteering for administration, organisation, and promotion of concerts and workshops should be measured and compared against the data from before the website was redeveloped. </li>
</ul>

<i>To increase ticket sales of concerts</i>
<ul>
<li>The number of tickets sold online and offline should be measured against the number sold before the website reestablishment. </li>
<li>Again, web analytics can be used to analyse online orders and in turn revenue generated online. Metrics that can be evaluated include sales conversion rates, number of purchases, revenue, and average number of orders per customer. These data can also be retrieved from Google Analytics.</li> 
<li>To track whether online marketing has an effect on offline ticket sales, customers buying directly from the offline store should be surveyed on where they heard about the ticket sales in the first place. </li>
<li>Offline-wise, ticket sales at the music centre itself can be tallied.</li>
</ul>

<i>To increase encourage performers to let us organise and cooperate with promotional materials</i>
<ul>
<li>To track whether there is an increase in the number of new or repeat performers over a set time period, a spreadsheet can be used to tally not only the quantity but also the cost of each performance and the number of customers.</li>
<li>Another spreadsheet can be used to note down which performing act is comfortable with cooperating with promotional materials over a set time period (such as a three month period). </li>
</ul>

</div>
 
<div id="tar"></div>
</p>
<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p>
<div id="wrapper">
<i>Geographic Target Market</i>
<ul>
<li>General Public</li>
<ul><li> Local residents (of Townsville, Australia)</li></ul>
<li>Visitors to Townsville</li>
</ul>

<i>Age Demographics</i>
<ul>
<li> Every concert is catered to different age demographics – therefore the website developed must cater to a wide range of ages. However, concerts accommodating to children should be developed for parents, as they would be accompanying their children and possibly are the parties responsible for retrieving information from the site.</li>
</ul>

<i>Further Comments to be put into consideration</i>
<ul>
<li> The client has specified that provide performance opportunities for a very wide range of styles and genres which would otherwise have little exposure. Henceforth, consumers can be of a niche target group.</li>
</ul>

<i>Why was this target audience chosen?</i>
<ul>
<li> With thirty years and more under its belt since its founding, Townsville Community Music Centre has catered to music tastes of its community. Henceforth the above mentioned geographic audience was targeted. However, it would also like to showcase its music to its visitors. 
As a result of the different concerts that will be held at Townsville Community Music Centre, a wide range of people of different ages and interests would be targeted. </li>
</ul>

<i>How would this website be designed to cater to its target audience?</i>
<ul>
<li>
Many design elements have to be taken into account for the varying usability levels of different age groups. As the client's target audience excludes children, design elements for teenages and adults should only be considered. Research from Nielsen Norman Group stated that scrolling and searching should be enhanced for them, while sound effects and website loading time should be reduced (Loranger & Nielsen, 2013).  Therefore, a minimalist web design (specifically a one web page design) should be used. A minimalist design will also work effectively on mobile phones, of which a significant number of the target audience use to browse the internet.  Social media links could also be utilised because their use is also prevalent in this generation.
